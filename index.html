          ___
          ### A prototype is an incomplete version of a software system being developed, that is used to demonstrate concepts, try out design options and, generally, to find out more about the problem and its possible solutions.
          
          + It is built so that the users can experience some of the proposed features and functionality of the software. 
          <br>
          <br>
          + Typically, it simulates only a few aspects of the features of the final system, but may be completely different from the final implementation.

          ##<center>**Evolutionary Protoyping**</center>

          The main goal of the evolutionary prototyping approach is to develop a
          mature, efficient, reliable, cost-effective software system or a solution
          through a series of prototyping iterations.

          The prototype undergoes continuous iterations and gets refined at each iteration.
          At each iteration, the implementation is handed over to the customer for their
          feedback. Ultimately, what started out as the prototype should become the solution.

          At each iteration, the system can be considered as first draft, second draft and
          so on till the final version is ready. Evolutionary prototyping is useful in developing systems where it is extremely
          difficult to establish a detailed system specification document.
