          ##<center>**What is prototyping**</center>
          ___
          ### A prototype is an incomplete version of a software system being developed, that is used to demonstrate concepts, try out design options and, generally, to find out more about the problem and its possible solutions.

          + It is built so that the users can experience some of the proposed features and functionality of the software.
          <br>
          <br>
          + Typically, it simulates only a few aspects of the features of the final system, but may be completely different from the final implementation.

          ___

          + ### A better quality system can be delivered
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          Many a times the developers may not fully understand the requirements and the expectations of the end users. Prototyping enables that the misunderstandings which occur can be identified and sorted out early on in the process.
          </p>

          + ### Problems can be identified early on
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          Using a prototype, makes a working system available early on in the process. The user can then identify possible improvements which can be made before the system is completed.
          </p>

          ___

          + ### Better involvement of end users
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          The end user feels more involved in the development of the system and will 'buy' into it.
          </p>


          + ### Leads to fulfillment of user requirements
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          A system which has been through prototyping will generally have an improved design quality and will be far closer to what the user needs.

          </p>

          + ### Cost savings
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          Identifying and rectifying the problems with the system in the early stages of development is less expensive than towards the end of the development phase.
          </p>

          + ### Training
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          The prototype developed can be used to help train the staff while the real system is still being under development.

          </p>

          ##<center>**Hardware Prototyping  vs  Software Prototyping**</center>
          ___

          ###Software prototyping and hardware prototyping have different objectives.


          + While developing hardware systems, a prototype is generally used to validate the system design.  eg. A prototype for an electronic system may be developed using previously used  components before investment is made in expensive and special integrated circuits to build the final version of the system.
          <br>
          <br>

          + A software prototype is not normally intended for design validation but to help develop and check the reality of the requirements for the system. The prototype design is usually different from that of the final software system.

          ##<center>**Introduction**</center>
          ___
          The main goal of the evolutionary prototyping approach is to develop a
          mature, efficient, reliable, cost-effective software system or a solution
          through a series of prototyping iterations.

          The prototype undergoes continuous iterations and gets refined at each iteration.
          At each iteration, the implementation is handed over to the customer for their
          feedback. Ultimately, what started out as the prototype should become the solution.

          At each iteration, the system can be considered as first draft, second draft and
          so on till the final version is ready. Evolutionary prototyping is useful in developing
          systems where it is extremely difficult to establish a detailed system specification document.

          ---
          ##<center>**Approach of Evolutionary Prorotyping**</center>
          ___

          An important factor that determines the success of this approach is the use of techniques and tools
          which allow for rapid system iterations. The changes that are suggested by the customer need to be
          incorporated and demonstrated again to the customer as quickly as possible. This can include the use
          of high level programming languages for software development, special environments, integrated software
          tools etc that can accelerate the developmen process.

          One key differnce between Evolutionary prototyping and specification-based approaches is the verification
          and validation. Verification is done by comparing the program, software system or solution to its
          specifications. Without having a specification, verification cannot be done. Validation process is done
          to ensure that the system is working as it is intended rather than its conformance to a speicifcation.

          ##<center>**Disadvantages**</center>
          ___

          Trying to decide how adequate a system is difficult as it is not measurable. Human performance is
          not always guaranteed to be correct but we are satisifed if performance is adequate for the current task.

          When it comes to developing systems that are expected to last a very long time, this could be a bigger
          problem. The main problems associated with evolutionary prototyoing are -

          - Prototypes usually develop so quickly that is not cost-effective to produce a great deal of system
            documentation and schedules.

          - Continuous changes to a system could lead to its corruption.

          - Generally for such approaches, small teams of highly skilled and passionate individuals have been used
            effectively. But it is still not clear as to what comprises the perfect team.

          - It is difficult to set a budget and schedule.

          ---
          ##<center>**Advantages**</center>
          ___

          - Since prototypes are generally developed quickly to get customer feedback quickly, this approach
          speeds up the delivery of the system. The changes suggested by the customer are implemented quickly
           and effectively.

          - The user is constantly involved with the team during the development of the software solution.

          - Constant customer interaction ensures that the end prodcut meets user requirements as much as possible.

          - There is constant refinement of the software product.

          - Compared to Throwaway Prototyping, the prototypes developed using this approach are functional prototypes,
           even though the developers may not have implemented all the features mentioned by the customer.
