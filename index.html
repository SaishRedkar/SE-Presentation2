          ##<center>**What is prototyping**</center>
          ___
          ### A prototype is an incomplete version of a software system being developed, that is used to demonstrate concepts, try out design options and, generally, to find out more about the problem and its possible solutions.
          
          + It is built so that the users can experience some of the proposed features and functionality of the software. 
          <br>
          <br>
          + Typically, it simulates only a few aspects of the features of the final system, but may be completely different from the final implementation.

          ___
        
          + ### A better quality system can be delivered
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          Many a times the developers may not fully understand the requirements and the expectations of the end users. Prototyping enables that the misunderstandings which occur can be identified and sorted out early on in the process.
          </p>

          + ### Problems can be identified early on
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          Using a prototype, makes a working system available early on in the process. The user can then identify possible improvements which can be made before the system is completed.
          </p>

          + ### Better involvement of end users
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          The end user feels more involved in the development of the system and will 'buy' into it.
          </p>


          + ### Leads to fulfillment of user requirements 
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          A system which has been through prototyping will generally have an improved design quality and will be far closer to what the user needs.

          </p>
          
          + ### Cost savings  
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          Identifying and rectifying the problems with the system in the early stages of development is less expensive than towards the end of the development phase.
          </p>

          + ### Training  
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>
          The prototype developed can be used to help train the staff while the real system is still being under development.

          </p>

          ##<center>**Hardware Prototyping  vs  Software Prototyping**</center>
          ___

          ###Software prototyping and hardware prototyping have different objectives.
          

          + While developing hardware systems, a prototype is generally used to validate the system design.  eg. A prototype for an electronic system may be developed using previously used  components before investment is made in expensive and special integrated circuits to build the final version of the system.
          <br>
          <br>

          + A software prototype is not normally intended for design validation but to help develop and check the reality of the requirements for the system. The prototype design is usually different from that of the final software system.

          ##<center>**Evolutionary Protoyping**</center>

          The main goal of the evolutionary prototyping approach is to develop a
          mature, efficient, reliable, cost-effective software system or a solution
          through a series of prototyping iterations.

          The prototype undergoes continuous iterations and gets refined at each iteration.
          At each iteration, the implementation is handed over to the customer for their
          feedback. Ultimately, what started out as the prototype should become the solution.

          At each iteration, the system can be considered as first draft, second draft and
          so on till the final version is ready. Evolutionary prototyping is useful in developing systems where it is extremely
          difficult to establish a detailed system specification document.
