          ___

          ##<u>Introduction:</u>
          The main goal of the evolutionary prototyping approach is to develop a
          mature, efficient, reliable, cost-effective software system or a solution
          through a series of prototyping iterations.

          The prototype undergoes continuous iterations and gets refined at each iteration.
          At each iteration, the implementation is handed over to the customer for their
          feedback. Ultimately, what started out as the prototype should become the solution.

          At each iteration, the system can be considered as first draft, second draft and
          so on till the final version is ready. Evolutionary prototyping is useful in developing systems where it is extremely
          difficult to establish a detailed system specification document.

          ___

          An important factor that determines the success of this approach is the use of techniques and tools
          which allow for rapid system iterations. The changes that are suggested by the customer need to be
          incorporated and demonstrated again to the customer as quickly as possible. This can include the use
          of high level programming languages for software development, special environments, integrated software
          tools etc that can accelerate the developmen process.

          One key differnce between Evolutionary prototyping and specification-based approaches is the verification
          and validation. Verification is done by comparing the program, software system or solution to its
          specifications. Without having a specification, verification cannot be done. Validation process is done
          to ensure that the system is working as it is intended rather than its conformance to a speicifcation.

          ___

          Trying to decide how adequate a system is difficult as it is not measurable. Human performance is
          not always guaranteed to be correct but we are satisifed if performance is adequate for the current task.

          When it comes to developing systems that are expected to last a very long time, this could be a bigger
          problem. The main problems associated with evolutionary prototyoing are -

           - Software management structures that currently exist usually deal with some software process model
           that generates regular deliverables to assess progress. Prototypes usually develop so quickly that
           is not cost-effective to produce a great deal of system documentation and schedules.

            - Continuous changes to a system could lead to its corruption. This is an important factor for
            prototyping methods as maintenance could be costlier and more difficult. Maintaining a software gets
            even harder when the maintenance teams are different from the development team.
